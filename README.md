# Running the code

To start the simulation, run main.py file using Python. Parameters can be found at the top of the main.py file. This code was tested using Python 3.5.2.

# Video

This short video illustrates dynamic area coverage and obstacle avoidance capabilities of 5 α-agents (mobile sensor nodes) controlled by anti-flocking algorithms proposed in the above paper.
